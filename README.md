## My process
While undertaking the project i followed a simple process which eased the challenge:
	a) Created a folder and initialized it with git and created the files needed for the challenge.
	a) Structured my content with HTML.
	b) Wrote out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`. 
	c) Added css styles from the top of the page and worked down.
	d) Configured and published my repositiry in github.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned
While undertaking this project i learned several new things in CSS which includes:
	a) Use of media screen with different widths.
	b) Styling HTML elements using the justify-content and align items
	c) Declalring global css variables by use of :root
	d) I also learned about a vs code extension(Five server) which allows you to create html pages
		without refreshing the browser every time you make a change in html and css files 


### Continued development
In the coming days i will be focusing on creating animations using css which has been a little chalenging to me 
and i am planning to perfect my skills on that area
